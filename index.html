	<h2>What is Neuroowl?</h2>

	<p>Neuroowl is a repository of evolving notes on topics related to Biological and Artificial Intelligence(AI).</p>
	
	<p>Although Neuroowl serves as an developmental, educational, and referential resource for myself, I make an effort for its contents to be interesting and beneficial to the reader.  The principles of intelligence are deep and profound so the topics discussed are certainly not exhaustive.  However, I attempt to be as precise as possible despite the difficulty and complexity of the material.  Additionally, these writings will change as I learn new ideas, learn fresh perspectives, correct mistakes, and add more visual examples.  Ultimately, technologically-applied intelligence will have profound impacts to humanity and I hope to share all that I have learned along my journey.</p>
