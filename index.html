		<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>
				Neuroowl is a repository of evolving notes on various topics relevant to 
				Artificial Intelligence(AI).  It serves as an educational and referential 
				resource for myself and other AI researchers.  The field is a broad and has
				decades of progress in philosophy, neuroscience, and technology.  Therefore,
				the topics presented are not exhaustive and chosen based on personal 
				interests.  Ultimately, the mission of this website is to serve humanity 
				through understanding biological intelligence and developing machine 
				intelligence.
			</p>
		<h2>Why is Machine Intelligence so important?</h2>
			<p>
				Everything we are, everything we do, every technology we've built, every song
				we've sung, every conscience decision we've made is due to a a chunk of 
				wrinkled meat if flattened would be no larger than the size of a dinner 
				napkin.
