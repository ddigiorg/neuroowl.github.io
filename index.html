	<p>Neuroowl is a repository of notes on topics related to intelligence and the technological application of intelligence principles, aka Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Although this website serves as an developmental, educational, and referential resource for myself, I make an effort for its contents to be interesting and beneficial to the reader.  This field is large, complex, and profound so these notes are not exhaustive and the ideas ever-evolving as I learn new material, learn fresh perspectives, correct mistakes, and add visual examples.  Ultimately, technologically-applied intelligence will have profound impacts to humanity and I hope to share all that I have learned along my journey.</p>
