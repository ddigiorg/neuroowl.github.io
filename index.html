		<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>
				Neuroowl is a repository of notes on topics related to Artificial 
				Intelligence(AI).  Although it serves as an educational and reference 
				resource for myself, I hope it will also be of benefit to other AI 
				researchers.  Ultimately, the mission of this website is to serve humanity 
				through understanding biological intelligence and developing machine 
				intelligence.

		<h2>Why is Machine Intelligence so important?</h2>

				Everything we are, everything we do, every technology we've built, every song

				wrinkled meat if flattened would be no larger than the size of a dinner 
				napkin.
