	<p>Neuroowl is a repository of evolving notes on topics related to Artificial Intelligence(AI) and the quest towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).  Although this website serves as an developmental, educational, and referential resource for myself, I make an effort for its contents to be interesting and beneficial to the reader as well.  Ultimately, AI along with other amazing technologies will have profound impacts to the future of humanity in all aspects of our lives and I hope to share all that I have learned along my journey through this age of intellectual exploration and development.</p>
