	<h1>Neocortex</h1>
		
	<p>
		The mammalian neocortex is considered the highest seat of intelligence and is primarily responsible for producing humanity’s great technological, 
		philosophical, and cultural works.  The human neocortex is a sheet of neural tissue occupying about 75% of the brain’s volume, is around 2-4 mm thick, and 
		is about 2,500 square cm in area (roughly the size of a dinner napkin) [6].  It is wrapped around older brain structures and the wrinkles, its defining 
		physical characteristic , help increase the neocortical surface area within the skull.  Just one square mm of this neural sheet has about 100 thousand 
		neurons and 1 billion synapses.  The neocortex is distributed in six layers, containing additional sublayers, based on differences in the relative density 
		of neurons, axons, and synapses as well as interconnections to the rest of the brain [6].  Despite structural differences found in neocortical regions 
		(mostly different neuron types and more or less layers/sublayers) the neocortex is remarkably homogeneous in the behavioral principles of cells and cortical 
		areas [6].  By understanding how sensation and perception work within these areas, we gain valuable insight into building more capable models and explaining 
		how existing models work.
