	<h2>Neural Structures</h2>
		
	<p>
		Sensory nervous systems are complex networks of interlinked sensors called “cells”, which are collections of receptors forming a single sophisticated sensor 
		that detects stimuli.  The cells thought to be primarily responsible for intelligent behavior in the neocortex are called “neurons”.  A neuron has a cell 
		body called the “soma”, one or more branching structures called “dendrites” containing receptors called “synapses”, and a tubular structure called the “axon”
		for outputting action potentials.  The most common type of neuron in the neocortex is the pyramidal neuron which has thousands of dendrites forming synaptic 
		connections to axons of other cells in various areas internal or external to the cortical hierarchy.  Synapses are receptors that detect stimuli, covering 
		dendrites much like the leaves of a tree.  These structures are thought to be the most fundamental memory storage and learning unit of the neocortex.  Thus
		dynamically interacting stimulus-receptor networks like the sensory nervous system are built from these axon-synapse connections.
