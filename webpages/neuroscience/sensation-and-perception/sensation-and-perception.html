	<h1>Sensation and Perception</h1>

	<p>
		An intelligent entity exists, observes, and interacts in an environment, a place where concepts have causal relationship to each other.  Humans call our 
		environment the “Universe", where energy and matter exist and behave through natural laws applied to concepts like "space", "time", "gravity", 
		"electromagnetism", “quantum physics”, etc.  These laws give rise to, cause, or explain relatively stable spatial structures and recurring temporal events 
		within the Universe.  Due to this causal natural order of the environment, biological nervous systems are able to witness and react to recurring knowledge 
		(patterns and sequences) in the environment.  Therefore intelligent entities use large networks of sensors to sense, perceive, predict, and learn patterns 
		and sequences from the environment as well as influence the environment through patterns and sequences of motor actions.  Thus a fundamental understanding 
		of sensation is a good starting point for understanding the basic principles of intelligence.

	<h2>Sensation</h2>

	<p>
		Sensation is simply the detection of stimulation in an environment.  A stimulus (plural stimuli) is a detectable phenomenon.  Examples include light 
		frequency (color), sound frequency (pitch), chemicals (tastes and smells), and spikes of voltage (electrical action potentials).  A receptor is a structure 
		that receives streams of stimuli and outputs a signal when it detects specific stimuli.  Examples include photoreceptors (vision), mechanoreceptors 
		(hearing and touch), chemoreceptors (taste and smell), and synapses (electrical action potentials).  A receptor’s output signal is a discrete temporal 
		marker [16] indicating the occurrence of specific phenomenon in a stream within a range of time.  For example, take a receptor that receives one stream of 
		stimuli and only outputs a signal when it detects blue light.  Initially the receptor receives red light for a time, but eventually it receives a burst of 
		blue light.  This color change causes the receptor to output a signal, announcing the blue stimulus was recognized.  Thus the most basic unit of sensory 
		systems are sensory receptors that output a signal when they detect specific stimuli.
	</p>

	<p>
		Receptors that receive multiple sensory streams operate purely on temporal relationships.  They do so in two ways: concurrently or sequentially [16].  
		Concurrent stimuli are multiple detectable phenomena in an environment that occur within a single time range.  For example, a computer screen is a 2D array 
		of pixels.  The light emitted from this array hits your retina within a very narrow range in time, allowing the brain to recognize spatial objects.  
		Sequential stimuli are multiple detectable phenomena in an environment that occur during different time ranges, usually proceeding one after another.  
		Continuing the example of the computer screen, the changes of a pixel from red to green to blue are sequential stimuli.

	</p>

	<h2>Perception</h2>

	<p>
		Perception is the basis of prediction, expectation, sophisticated object recognition (occlusion, invariance, and discrimination), and attention.  Perception 
		functions like sensation (response to detected phenomenon), however it utilizes stimuli from the memories of the sensory nervous system to make sense of the 
		observed stimuli.  For example, perception (“top-down” processing) is understanding you are seeing a chair, but sensation (“bottom-up” processing) is simply 
		your eyes detecting light waves.  Other intuitive examples of perception are found in optical illusions, which demonstrate the brain uses memories to make 
		sense of the environment, as shown in Figure 1.2.  Thus a receptor “perceives” rather than “senses” when it receives stimuli from an internal sensory 
		receptor that doesn’t directly observe the external environment.
