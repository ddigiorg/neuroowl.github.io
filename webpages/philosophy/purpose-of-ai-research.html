	<h1>Purpose of AI Research</h1>

	"Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make..." -I. J. Good <sup>[1]</sup>

	The quest to understand and apply the principles of intelligence is the most profound human philosophical, technical, and engineering endeavor.  In fact, it may be the ultimate human invention, a wellspring of 
	unimaginable benefits.  Not only will understanding intelligence provide us remarkable technologies, but also it will provide a deeper understanding of the essence of being.



	Human existance is characterized by a fair bit of suffering.  We're limited creatures and life is very hard.  Everyone dies, everyone you love is going to die.  All of the things you do will eventually fail.  
	Suffering is a certainty.

	Personal Purpose: grow stronger and inspire others to grow stronger

	The mission statement: 
		short term survival and prosperity of species
		long term survivial of intelligent life

	The fundamental question: why (a unique human reflection)
		why have intelligent life in the first place
		survival and procreation
		why survive? what is survival? a continuous order of material components?
		why procreate?

	small incremental changes

	Humanity's Legacy

	The search for meaning

	Why bother?  In millions of years into the future humanity will not exist in a state we are familiar with, or will not exist at all

	Reduce the amount of unecessary and forced suffering

	Some suffering is necessary.  It grows us into compassionate people.

	As of now in this limited perspective, a true general AI will be the ultimate human technological development.

	All things technology, art, culture, music, business, is because of our neocortex.

	Humanity's limited perspective, limited intelligence
	

	if life is suffering why bother with it?  Suffering is real and inescapabile.  What do you do about it?

	Supposition: If you knew enough about the world you wouldnt die.

	AI will aid us in the search for meaning, will help define what it means to be human
