	<h1>Purpose of AI Research</h1>

	<h2>The Importance of AI</h2>

	<p>
	Mankind's quest to understand and apply the principles of intelligence is the most significant endeavor of our existence.  All great works of man, the blessings of modernity, and the marvels of our species stem from 
	the most important six inches of our lives and the seat of our intelligence, our brain.  Since the dawn of our earliest ancestors, human cognitive labor has reaped a bountiful intellectual, technological, and cultural 
	harvest.  This crop of the mind includes an inexhaustible list of achievements and wonders: reason, science, engineering, philosophy, agriculture, the free market, democracy, art,	music, literature, poetry, drama, 
	fiction, and many other examples.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	By using our intelligence, a significant population of mankind has transcended an otherwise vicious life of unnecessary suffering and a propensity for animalistic violence.  This is not an attempt to overlook or excuse 
	the cold reality of our ever-present animal nature, the unique malevolence spawned from human cognitive abilities, or the troubles people still face today.  In fact, constant knowledge and reminder of these concepts are 
	crucially important and will be discussed on this website.  However despite our dark side, the ultimate source of human success and prosperity thus far	is due to our intelligence.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Because intelligence thus far has been beneficial to all areas of our lives, the next logical (and perhaps inevitable) step is to build intelligent machines.  Throughout history technology has enabled men and women to
	do more with less: the loom which provided less-expensive higher-quality clothing, the printing press enabling the distribution of books and an education revolution, advances in agriculture and medicine allows for 
	longer lives and less suffering, and many other examples.  It is important to note that the rate at which technology has grown is not linear, it is exponential.  Moore's law
	</p>

	<p>
	Therefore, technologically-applied intelligence is the ultimate human invention.

	<h2>The Purpose</h2>

	<p>The purpose of artificial intelligence research is to ensure the survival, prosperity, and legacy of the human race.</p>

		The first purpose of AI research is the survival of the human species.

		Survival: the state or fact of continuing to live or exist.
		Exist:  have objective reality or being.
		Being:  existance.  the nature or essence of a person
		Essence: the intrinsic nature or indispensable quality of something, especially something abstract, that determines its character.

		the two fundamental goals of animal nature is survival and procreation.

		small incremental changes

		why survive? what is survival? a continuous order of material components?  survival of the individual
		why procreate?  survival of species

		AI could destroy us, but many other factors could destroy us.  A game of risks and rewards

		Supposition: If you knew enough about the world you wouldnt die.

		soul is the immeterial timeless abstraction of essence.

		abstraction: the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.

		Reduction of coersive force and unecessary suffering

		The reality of human existance is characterized by a fair bit of suffering.  We're limited creatures and life is very hard.  Everyone dies, everyone you love is going to die.  All of the things you do will eventually fail.
		Suffering is a certainty.  So why bother?  In millions of years into the future humanity will not exist in a state we are familiar with, or will not exist at all.


		Artificial Intelligence promises a wellspring of unimaginable benefits.  

		Personal Purpose: grow stronger and inspire others to grow stronger

		Reduce the amount of unecessary suffering

		Some suffering is necessary.  It grows us into compassionate people.

		if life is suffering why bother with it?  Suffering is real and inescapabile.  What do you do about it?

	<label for="3"><h3>3. Legacy</h3></label>
	<div>
		WIP
		
		Legacy of intelligent life

		In millions of years

		AI will aid us in the search for meaning, will help define what it means to be human

		As of now in this limited perspective, a true general AI will be the ultimate human technological development.

		Humanity's limited perspective, limited intelligence

		why have intelligent life in the first place?  Not only will understanding intelligence provide us remarkable technologies, but also it will provide a deeper understanding of the essence of being.
