	<h1>Why Build AI?</h1>

	<h2>The Mission</h2>

	<p>Understand the principles of intelligence and apply that knowledge to build cognitive-capable technology.</p>

	<h2>The Purpose</h2>

	<p>The quest to complete this mission is the most significant endeavor of human existence.  Its purpose is to ensure the survival, prosperity, and legacy of the human race.</p>

		The first purpose of AI research is the survival of the human species.

		Survival: the state or fact of continuing to live or exist.
		Exist:  have objective reality or being.
		Being:  existance.  the nature or essence of a person
		Essence: the intrinsic nature or indispensable quality of something, especially something abstract, that determines its character.

		the two fundamental goals of animal nature is survival and procreation.

		small incremental changes

		why survive? what is survival? a continuous order of material components?  survival of the individual
		why procreate?  survival of species

		AI could destroy us, but many other factors could destroy us.  A game of risks and rewards

		Supposition: If you knew enough about the world you wouldnt die.

		soul is the immeterial timeless abstraction of essence.

		abstraction: the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.

	<div>
		WIP

		Reduction of coersive force and unecessary suffering

		The reality of human existance is characterized by a fair bit of suffering.  We're limited creatures and life is very hard.  Everyone dies, everyone you love is going to die.  All of the things you do will eventually fail.
		Suffering is a certainty.  So why bother?  In millions of years into the future humanity will not exist in a state we are familiar with, or will not exist at all.


		Artificial Intelligence promises a wellspring of unimaginable benefits.

		Personal Purpose: grow stronger and inspire others to grow stronger

		Reduce the amount of unecessary suffering

		Some suffering is necessary.  It grows us into compassionate people.

		if life is suffering why bother with it?  Suffering is real and inescapabile.  What do you do about it?

		Persuit of happiness, joy, efficacy, fufillment

	<div>
		WIP

		Legacy of intelligent life

		In millions of years

		AI will aid us in the search for meaning, will help define what it means to be human

		As of now in this limited perspective, a true general AI will be the ultimate human technological development.

		Humanity's limited perspective, limited intelligence

		why have intelligent life in the first place?  Not only will understanding intelligence provide us remarkable technologies, but also it will provide a deeper understanding of the essence of being.

	<h2>Human Cognitive History</h2>

	<p>
	All great works of man, the blessings of modernity, and the marvels of our species stem from the most important six inches of our lives, the brain.  Since the dawn of our earliest ancestors, human cognitive labor has 
	reaped a bountiful harvest.  This crop of the mind includes an inexhaustible list of achievements and wonders: reason, science, engineering, philosophy, agriculture, the free market, democracy, art, music, literature, 
	poetry, drama, fiction, and many other examples.  Throughout history technological progress enabled men and women to do more with less.  For example:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Agriculture & Medicine: longer lives and less suffering</li>
		<li>The Loom: less-expensive and higher-quality clothing</li>
		<li>The Printing Press: enabled the distribution of books causing educational revolution</li>
		<li>The Internet: connects people across the globe</li>
		<li>And many more examples...</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	By applying our intelligence strengthened by a powerful mammalian neocortex, our species survives and thrives in a world where a significant population of mankind has transcended a naturally vicious life of unnecessary 
	suffering and propensity for animalistic violence.  This does not overlook or excuse the unique malevolence spawned from human cognitive abilities or the troubles people face today or throughout history.  In fact, 
	constant vigilance of these concepts are crucially important for the survival of our species.  However despite this dark side, the ultimate source of human success and prosperity thus far is due to our intelligence.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Despite the wonderful advancements, there are some natural limitations to human capabilities for productivity.  An illustration of this can be found in the quote, "The richest place on Earth is the graveyard".

	Examples of our limitations
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Death</li>
		<li>????:  We are our own worst enemy and people constantly fail to live up to their potential</li>
		<li>Senses:  We only have 5 senses... vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste</li>
		<li>Environment: Cant easily live in space but so many resources up there</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Human & AI Cognitive Future</h2>

	<p>
	As history has shown, because of our human limitations we build tools to survive and thrive.
	</p>

	<p>
	Because of this profound success, the next logical (and perhaps inevitable) step is to build intelligent machines.    It is important to note that the rate at which technology has grown so far is not linear, but exponential.  The less capable yesterday's technology built the 
	more capable today's technology which will build the even more capable tomorrow's technology.  Thinking machines build better thinking machines to build better thinking machines....

	Therefore, technologically-applied intelligence is the ultimate human invention.
