	<h1>Applications of AI</h1>

	<p>
	What are the practical applications of AI and how might it serve humanity?  
	Well, it would take an absurdly creative mind to list even a fraction of the potential applications and scenerios.  Just look at the amazing things humans have done with our meat brains and imagine the possibilities!

			Humans directly experience perceived reality within specific sensory systems like sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell. However, we know of forces beyond our direct sensory experience like 	electromagnetism,
			ultrasound, data flow through the internet, gravity, quantum forces, et al.  These indirect sensations require equipment and technology to transform indirect information to direct, human intuitive information
			like mathematical and graphical models.

			A machine cortex may operate like a human cortex: pattern recognition, inference, prediction, creativity, selective attention, etc. However, a machine intelligence is not bound by human biological sensing
			capabilities.  All human wonders of technology, art, and culture have been achieved through these 5 senses supplemented by models.  What undreamed of could AI create if they had an intuitive sense of sensory spaces
			humans labor their whole lives to grasp and understand.  Imagine if you could figuratively "see" gravity.  Advanced	concepts like special relativity would be relatively intuitive, much like seeing your pet dog or cat
			lick itself.  Imagine you could directly access the wireless internet with your brain by sensing the right electromagnetic waves.
