	<h1>Superintelligence</h1>

	<p>"Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make..." -I. J. Good <sup>[1]</sup></p>

		Because of this profound success, the next logical (and perhaps inevitable) step is to build intelligent machines.    It is important to note that the rate at 
		which technology has grown so far is not linear, but exponential.  The less capable yesterday's technology built the more capable today's technology which will
		build the even more capable tomorrow's technology.  Thinking machines build better thinking machines to build better thinking machines....
