	<h1>Defining Intelligence</h1>

	<p>"The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms" -Socrates.</p>

	<p>Understanding intelligence is difficult because the philosophical and scientific community disagrees on even basic concepts and definition of terms related to the topic.  Furthermore the architecture behind intelligence, the brain, is so complex that extracting salient principles of intelligence seems beyond anyone's ability.  Despite disagreements, I attept to define relevent terms as a starting point for the ideas presented below.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Chaos</b> - behavior so unpredictable as to appear random</li>
		<li><b>Order</b> - predictable behavior where the concepts are in relation to each other</li>
		<li><b>Environment</b> - A natural order of stimulae where an intelligence exists and operates in</li>
		<li><b>Artificial</b> - made by human beings</li>
		<li><b>Natural</b> - made by nature</li>
		<li><b>Stimulus</b> - a detectable change in the environment</li>
		<li><b>Sensation</b> - detection of stimulus</li>
		<li><b>Sensor</b> - that which responds to stimulus</li>
		<li><b>Sensitivity</b> - the degree to which a sensor is able to respond to a stimulus</li>
		<li><b>Threshold</b> - </li>

		<li><b>Pattern</b> - a concurrent responce to stimulae</li>
		<li><b>Sequence</b> - a temporal order of stimulae</li>
		
		<li><b>Percept</b> - an object or concept of perception (i.e. "chair")</li>
		<li><b>Perception</b> - the organization, identification, and interpretation of stimulae shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention in order to represent and understand the environment</li>
		<li><b>Perceptor</b> - that which percieves</li>
		
		<li><b>Knowledge</b> - patterns and sequences of memories</li>
		<li><b>Learn</b> - aquisition of knowledge</li>
		<li><b>Memory</b> - stored knowledge</li>

		<li><b>Expectation</b> -</li>
		<li><b>Predict</b> - to expect a pattern or sequence will happen in the future, often as a consequence of knowledge and/or memory</li>
		<li><b>Attention</b> - focus on a discrete aspect of stimulation or perception while ignoring other stimulation or perception</li>	
		
		<li><b>Intelligence</b> - the ability to aquire and apply knowledge</li>
		<li><b>Sentience</b> - the ability to experience sensations</li>
		<li><b>Conscious</b> - the ability to maintain an awareness of self and environment</li>
	</ul>	

	the awareness that you are having your own thoughts
	Experience makes you you. You are not just your cells or your brain nor your and, you are the information you store inside you while you live and learn.

	unconscious -
	subconscious -
	Carl Jung said that since there is a limit to what can be held in conscious focal awareness, an alternative storehouse of one's knowledge and prior experience is needed.[9]

	awareness - knowledge or perception of a situation or fact.
	qualia
		
	Consciousness: having knowledge of (perception of) a situation or fact in one's environment
	the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.
	the thing that tends to the unknown/anomoly and integrates it to the structure
	(one of the difficulties of studying it is that it means different things to different people)
	no articulated knowledge, no self representation
	the knowledge that you exist.  Knowledge of the borders of your space and time. (WIP)

	Attention: notice taken of someone or something; the regarding of someone or something as interesting or important.
		
	meaning(value)

	The only thing that matters in the brain is the temporal relationships between the pulses. They are either concurrent or sequential.

	<p>[PLACE VISUAL EXAMPLE OF DEFINITIONS HERE]</p>

	<h1>Discussion</h1>

	<p>The above defined terms give a foundation to the ideas presented in this section.</p>

	The ultimate model of reality for an intelligence is the environment it senses.  

	Everything exists because it is perceivable.  Everything is perceivable because it exists.

	<label for="l"><h3>Environment and Observer: The Balance of Chaos and Order</h3></label>
	<div>
		chaos: things are so complex you cant handle it
		order: things are so ridged it's too restrictive... Cause and Effect
		in between that is a place that's meaningful

		<p>
		Humans call our environment "Universe" which is governed by natural laws, concepts intelligence observes and humans have labeled "space", "time", "gravity", "nuclear forces", "electromagnetism", etc.  Natural laws
		have order, recurring concepts that give rise to predictability.  For example, Earth revolves around the Sun in an ellipse taking 365 days for a single orbit.  Earth does not randomly careen away from the Sun or
		explode into a soup of ever-changing infinite impossibilities.  Therefore we can predict Earth will exist as-is and revolve around the Sun as long as the natural order, understood or not, remains stable.

	Every time you learn something you learn because something you did didnt work and that exposes a part of the world you dont understand then you have the possibility to rebuild the structures you use to interpert the world

	(REWRITE) memory has a hierarchy of value and emotional signifigance geared towards functional utility.  Focused attention on things that are valued.  You cant look at the world without a VALUE STRUCTURE.  Chaos if everything is equally important and unimportant.  	Invisible gorilla experiment.  Changing clerk experiment.  	Belief(value) systems structure your perceptions and also guide your actions because you conciously or unconsciously act in accordance to your values.

	intelligence is intertwined with its environment.


	Perception can be split into two processes.[4] Firstly, processing sensory input, which transforms these low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition). Secondly, processing which is connected with a person's concepts and expectations (knowledge) and selective mechanisms (attention) that influence perception.

you have the unknown world and thats what you dont know at all that's the outside, the ocean that surrounds the island you inhabit.  It's chaos itself and you act in that world.
Theres more to your actions than you can understand 

Everybody acts out a myth but very few people know what their myth is.  You should know what your myth is because it might be a tragedy.

mardok story: using attention and language to confront those things that most threaten us (real or psycological threats)

pain is the fundamental reality because no one disputes it


consciousness gives illumination to being

whats out there if theres nothing to experience it.  Everything at once?  Ultimate chaos? Ultimate order?  Not comprehensible 

there something that isnt material in the way that we understand material in thw way that we understand consciousness

we dont understand conciousness, but the fact that it is necessary for the world to exist is a perfectly reasonable metaphysical proposition because it is not easy to understand or describe what being would be if there was no one conscious to experience it


conscious use of language calls forth new types of being (our capacity to use language and creativity to shape the direction of the world)

1 - Formless chaos from which things emerge
2 - a structure that gives rise to the order that emerges out of that chaos
3 - active principle that that structure uses to do that 

sentient creatures do face the chaotic possibility of being (the future), make decisions about how it is that they are going to extract the world out of that potential, use communication as teh means by which that occours
and that determines the direction of the unfolding of reality

 There is only one time now. Sure there is a reverberation of now (past). There is also a expectation of things to come (future). But the only time that ever exists from any perceptual view is now.

The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness.

dualism
- light vs dark
- conscious vs unconscious
- beginning vs end
- positive vs negative



Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be changed from one form to another. Albert Einstein

Like energy, consciousness cannot be created or destroyed.

We do not see things the way they are; we see things the way we are.




The brain learns to make sense of the way the world changes over time
