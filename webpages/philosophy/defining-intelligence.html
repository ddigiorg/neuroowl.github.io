	<h1>Defining Intelligence</h1>

	"The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms" -Socrates.

	Understanding intelligence is a difficult endeavor.  There are so many interacting concepts and disagreements on intelligence, that extracting the salient principles of intelligence seems beyond one mortal's ability.
	In order to construct a basic understanding AI, I provide definitions:

	Artificial: Made by human beings.
	Natural: Made by nature.
	Intelligence: The ability to acquire and apply knowledge.
	Sentience: The knowledge that you exist.  Knowledge of the borders of your space and time. (WIP)
	Knowledge: A pattern learned from the changes an environment.
	Sensation: Detection of stimululation.
	Stimulus: A detectable change in the environment. (i.e. light waves, sound waves, etc.)
	Sensitivity: The degree to which a sensor is able to detect stimulation. 
	Perception: the organization, identification, and interpretation of sensory information shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention in order to represent and understand the environment.
	Percept: Something that is perceived. (i.e. "chair")
	Pattern: A perceivable regularity in an environment.  As such, the elements of a pattern repeat in a predictable manner.


	Consciousness: having knowledge of (perception of) a situation or fact in one's environment
	the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.
	the thing that tends to the unknown/anomoly and integrates it to the structure
	(one of the difficulties of studying it is that it means different things to different people)

	Attention: notice taken of someone or something; the regarding of someone or something as interesting or important.
	Learning:
	Memory:
	Expectation:
	Prediction:  say or estimate that (a specified thing) will happen in the future or will be a consequence of something.

	


	Humans are part of nature, tehrefore the intelligence we produce is natural.
	
	The ultimate model of reality for an intelligence is the environment it perceives.  

	Everything exists because it is perceivable.  Everything is perceivable because it exists.

	
	Sensation

	Cause and Effect

	Chaos and Order
	
	
	meaning(value)

	### Chaos and Order

	chaos: behavior so unpredictable as to appear random
		things are so complex you cant handle it

	order: the arrangement or disposition of people or things in relation to each other according to a particular sequence, pattern, or method.
		things are so ridged it's too restrictive

	in between that is a place that's meaningful

	
	Humans call this environment "Universe" which is governed by natural laws, concepts intelligence observes and humans have labeled "space", "time", "gravity", "nuclear forces", "electromagnetism", etc.  Natural laws have order, recurring concepts that give rise to predictability.  For example, Earth revolves around the Sun in an ellipse taking 365 days for a single orbit.  Earth does not randomly careen away from the Sun or explode into a soup of ever-changing infinite impossibilities.

	Therefore we can predict Earth will exist as-is and revolve around the Sun as long as the natural order, understood or not, remains stable.


	
	Every time you learn something you learn because something you did didnt work and that exposes a part of the world you dont understand then you have the possibility to rebuild the structures you use to interpert the world

	(REWRITE) memory has a hierarchy of value and emotional signifigance geared towards functional utility.  Focused attention on things that are valued.  You cant look at the world without a VALUE STRUCTURE.  Chaos if everything is equally important and unimportant.  	Invisible gorilla experiment.  Changing clerk experiment.  	Belief(value) systems structure your perceptions and also guide your actions because you conciously or unconsciously act in accordance to your values.

	intelligence is intertwined with its environment.


	Perception can be split into two processes.[4] Firstly, processing sensory input, which transforms these low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition). Secondly, processing which is connected with a person's concepts and expectations (knowledge) and selective mechanisms (attention) that influence perception.
