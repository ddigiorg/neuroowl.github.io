	<h1>Defining Intelligence</h1>

	<p>"The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms" -Socrates.</p>

	<p>
	Understanding intelligence is difficult because it involves an ongoing, ever-evolving philosophical discussion and scientific research.  Often ideas on the topic mean different things to different people.  Definitions
	sometimes overlap with and involve other definitions, producing a confusing mess of terms.  This is especially prevalent in discussions of consciousness, an extremely complex and heavily debated topic.  Furthermore, the
	most plausible architecture of intelligence, the nervous system, is not yet well understood by the scientific community.  Therefore, extracting the salient principles of intelligence from biology and engineering seems
	beyond anyone's ability as of now.  Despite the lack of consensus on the subject, I attept to define precise, distinct, and basic relavent terms to facilitate the discussions below.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Environment</b> - where entities exist and have causal relation to each other</li>
		<li><b>Stimulus(-ae)</b> - detectable change(s) in the environment</li>
		<li><b>Pattern</b> - responce to concurrent stimulae</li>
		<li><b>Sequence</b> - response to temporal stimulae</li>
		<li><b>Knowledge</b> - patterns and sequences</li>
		<li><b>Learning</b>- storing and/or modifying knowledge</li>
		<li><b>Memories</b> - stored knowledge</li>
		<li><b>Thinking</b> - processing memories</li>
		<li><b>Intelligence</b> - the ability to aquire and apply knowledge</li>
		<li><b>Sentience</b> - the ability to experience sensations</li>
		<li><b>Sapience</b> - the ability to think</li>
		<li><b>Conscious</b> - the ability to maintain an awareness of self and environment</li>

			The ultimate model of reality for an intelligence is the environment it senses.

			An intelligent entity can not live independantly of an environment.

			What's out there if theres nothing to experience it?  Everything at once?  Ultimate chaos? Ultimate order?  Not comprehensible

			it is not easy to understand or describe what being would be if there was no one conscious to experience it

			Sensation makes space and time meaningful.  What is a million years or a thousand light-years to an entity which does not measure these concepts?
		</p>

		<p>
		Humans tend to call our environment "The World" or "The Universe" where matter and energy exist and interact with each other governed by natural laws, concepts we call "space", "time", "gravity",	"nuclear forces",
		"electromagnetism", et al.  These natural laws allow to entities and events to occour with regularity and predictability.  For example, Earth orbits the Sun in an ellipse taking ~365 days per revolution.	 Earth does 
		not explode into a soup of ever-changing infinite impossibilities and does not careen away from the Sun for no reason.  This means our environment is governed by a complex interaction of causes and effects.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Chaos</b> - Has no cause and effect relationship between entities.  Extremely complex and unpredictable.</li>
			<li><b>Order</b> - Has cause and effect relationship between entities.  Has predictability.</li>
		</ul>

		observer: in between that is a place that's meaningful.  The brain learns to make sense of the way the world changes over times
		
		conscience: Knowledge of the borders of your space and time. (WIP) the awareness that you are having your own thoughts
		Experience makes you you. You are not just your cells or your brain nor your and, you are the information you store inside you while you live and learn.
										
		sentient creatures do face the chaotic possibility of being (the future), make decisions about how it is that they are going to extract the world out of that potential, use communication as the means by which that 
		occours	and that determines the direction of the unfolding of reality

		There is only one time now. Sure there is a reverberation of now (past). There is also a expectation of things to come (future). But the only time that ever exists from any perceptual view is now.

		1 - Formless chaos from which things emerge
		2 - a structure that gives rise to the order that emerges out of that chaos
		3 - active principle that that structure uses to do that

		Artificial - made by human beings
		Natural - made by nature

		It is impossible to know everything because an entity would have to be everything

		<p>"Seeing is believing"</p>

		<p>
		Sensation is simply the detection of stimulation.   It consists of a device called a sensor that responds to stimulus (e.g. light, sound, heat, neuron action potentials, etc).  Both stimulus (input) and response 
		(output) may be binary or analog depending on the type of sensor.  Sensors have two properties: 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Threshold</b> - the point at which a changing stimulus causes a sensor to respond</li>
			<li><b>Sensitivity</b> - the degree to which a changing stimulus causes a sensor to change its response</li>
		</ul>

		<img src="/webpages/philosophy/sensation.png" alt="sensation" style="margin: 25px auto">
		
		<p>
		Additionally, a sensor may respond to more than one stimulus in two ways: concurrently or sequentually.  This means that sensors look for temporal relationships between stimulae.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Pattern</b> - a responce to concurrent stimulae.  This represents the concept of "space", the relationship between two or more stimulae at a single point in time.</li>
			<li><b>Sequence</b> - a response to temporal stimulae.  This represents the concept of "time", the relationship between two or more stimulae at different points in time.</li>
		</ul>

	<label for="3"><h3>Perception</h3></label>
	<div>
		<p>"We do not see things the way they are; we see things the way we are."</p>

		<p>
		Perception is the organization, identification, and interpretation of stimulae shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention in order to represent and understand the environment.	 An intuition for the 
		difference between sensation and perception may be found in illusions.

		[INSERT PIC OF NEON COLOR SPREADING]



		Percept - an object or concept of perception, a high-level sensation (i.e. "chair")
		Perceptor - that which percieves

		Perception can be split into two processes:
		- 1. Bottom Up: processing sensory input, transforming low-level knowledge to higher-level knowledge.  (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition). 
		- 2. Top Down: processing which is connected with memories and attention that influence perception.

		
		Attention - focus on a discrete aspect of stimulation or perception while ignoring other stimulation or perception
		Predict - to expect a pattern or sequence will happen in the future, often as a consequence of knowledge and/or memory

		

		Every time you learn something you learn because something you did didnt work and that exposes a part of the world you dont understand then you have the possibility to rebuild the structures you use to interpert the world

		(REWRITE) memory has a hierarchy of value and emotional signifigance geared towards functional utility.  Focused attention on things that are valued.  You cant look at the world without a VALUE STRUCTURE.  
		Chaos if everything is equally important and unimportant.  	Invisible gorilla experiment.  Changing clerk experiment.  	Belief(value) systems structure your perceptions and also guide your actions because you 
		conciously or unconsciously act in accordance to your values.

		Sapience comes from the Latin word sapiens (wise) which is also the source of the scientific name for humans, Homo Sapiens.  The opposite is "instinct"
