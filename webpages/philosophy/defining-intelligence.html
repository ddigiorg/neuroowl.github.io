	<h1>Defining Intelligence</h1>

	<p>"The beginning of wisdom is the definition of terms" -Socrates.</p>

	<p>
	Understanding intelligence is difficult because it involves ongoing, ever-evolving philosophical discussion and scientific research.  Often ideas on the topic mean different things to different people.  Definitions
	sometimes overlap with and involve other definitions, producing a confusing mess of terms.  This is especially prevalent in discussions of consciousness, an extremely complex and involved topic.  Furthermore the most 
	plausible architecture of intelligence, the nervous system, is not yet well understood by the scientific community.  Therefore, extracting salient principles of intelligence from biology and engineering 
	seems beyond anyone's ability as of now.  Despite the lack of consensus on the subject, I attept to define precise, distinct, and basic relavent terms to facilitate the discussions below.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Environment</b> - where concepts and entities exist and have relation to each other</li>
		<li><b>Stimulus</b> - a detectable change in the environment</li>
		<li><b>Sensor</b> - that which responds to stimulus</li>
		<li><b>Pattern</b> - a responce to concurrent stimulae</li>
		<li><b>Sequence</b> - a response to temporal stimulae</li>
		<li><b>Knowledge</b> - patterns and sequences</li>
		<li><b>Intelligence</b> - the ability to aquire and apply knowledge</li>
		<li><b>Sentience</b> - the ability to experience sensations</li>
		<li><b>Sapience</b> - the ability to think about knowledge</li>
		<li><b>Conscious</b> - the ability to maintain an awareness of self and environment</li>
	</ul>

		<p>"Everything is sensable because it exists.  Everything exists because it is sensable."</p>
		
		<p>
		This means an intelligent entity can not live independantly of an environment.

		What's out there if theres nothing to experience it?  Everything at once?  Ultimate chaos? Ultimate order?  Not comprehensible
		</p>
		
		we dont understand conciousness, but the fact that it is necessary for the world to exist is a perfectly reasonable metaphysical proposition because it is not easy to understand or describe what being would be if
		there was no one conscious to experience it

		The ultimate model of reality for an intelligence is the environment it senses.

		conscience: Knowledge of the borders of your space and time. (WIP) the awareness that you are having your own thoughts
		Experience makes you you. You are not just your cells or your brain nor your and, you are the information you store inside you while you live and learn.
				
		Chaos - behavior so unpredictable as to appear random
		chaos: things are so complex you cant handle it
		
		Order - predictable behavior where the concepts are in relation to each other
		order: things are so ridged it's too restrictive... Cause and Effect
						
		observer: in between that is a place that's meaningful
		
		<p>
		Humans call the environment where we exist "Universe" where matter and energy exist and interact governed by natural laws.  These laws are concepts humans call "space", "time", "gravity", "nuclear forces", 
		"electromagnetism", et al.  These natural laws provide order, giving rise to stimulation with regularity and predictability.  For example, Earth revolves around the Sun in an ellipse taking 365 days for a single 
		orbit.  Earth does not randomly careen away from the Sun or explode into a soup of ever-changing infinite impossibilities.  Therefore we can predict Earth will exist as-is and revolve around the Sun as long as the 
		natural order, understood or not, remains stable.
		</p>
		
		The brain learns to make sense of the way the world changes over times

		sentient creatures do face the chaotic possibility of being (the future), make decisions about how it is that they are going to extract the world out of that potential, use communication as the means by which that 
		occours	and that determines the direction of the unfolding of reality

		There is only one time now. Sure there is a reverberation of now (past). There is also a expectation of things to come (future). But the only time that ever exists from any perceptual view is now.

		1 - Formless chaos from which things emerge
		2 - a structure that gives rise to the order that emerges out of that chaos
		3 - active principle that that structure uses to do that

		Artificial - made by human beings
		Natural - made by nature

	<label for="2"><h3>Sensation</h3></label>
	<div>
		<p>
			At the most basic level, sensation consists of a device called a sensor that responds to a stimulus (i.e. light, neuron action potentials, etc.).  The response may change as the stimulus changes.  For
			example, lets say there is a sensor that detects a stimulus called light brightness
		</p>

		[INSERT PIC OF RESPONSE SENSOR]

		A sensor may also respond to multiple stimulae in two ways: concurrently and sequentially.

		Interestingly, the spatial arrangement of sensors actually doesn't matter

		The nervous system of intelligent life is a network of sensors.  Therefore, the the fundamental language in the brain is the temporal relationships between the pulses.

		Sensitivity - the degree to which a sensor changes its response to a changing stimulus
		Threshold - the point at which a sensor responds to a changing stimulus

		sensation gives rise to the space and time a sensor responds to

	<label for="3"><h3>Perception</h3></label>
	<div>
		<p>"We do not see things the way they are; we see things the way we are."</p>


		Percept - an object or concept of perception, a high-level sensation
		Perceptor - that which percieves
		
		Perception - the organization, identification, and interpretation of stimulae shaped by learning, memory, expectation, and attention in order to represent and understand the environment

		Perception can be split into two processes:
		- 1. Bottom Up: processing sensory input, which transforms these low-level information to higher-level information (e.g., extracts shapes for object recognition). 
		- 2. Top Down: processing which is connected with a knowledge and attention that influence perception.

		percept (i.e. "chair")

		Learn - aquisition of knowledge
		Memory - stored knowledge
		
		Attention - focus on a discrete aspect of stimulation or perception while ignoring other stimulation or perception
		Predict - to expect a pattern or sequence will happen in the future, often as a consequence of knowledge and/or memory

		[INSERT PIC OF NEON COLOR SPREADING]

		Every time you learn something you learn because something you did didnt work and that exposes a part of the world you dont understand then you have the possibility to rebuild the structures you use to interpert the world

		(REWRITE) memory has a hierarchy of value and emotional signifigance geared towards functional utility.  Focused attention on things that are valued.  You cant look at the world without a VALUE STRUCTURE.  
		Chaos if everything is equally important and unimportant.  	Invisible gorilla experiment.  Changing clerk experiment.  	Belief(value) systems structure your perceptions and also guide your actions because you 
		conciously or unconsciously act in accordance to your values.

		Language is articulated knowledge

		conscious use of language calls forth new types of being (our capacity to use language and creativity to shape the direction of the world)

		Sapience comes from the Latin word sapiens (wise) which is also the source of the scientific name for humans, Homo Sapiens.  The opposite is "instinct"
