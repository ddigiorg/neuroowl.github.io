	<h1>Hierarchical Temporal Memory</h1>

	<p>Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a theoretical framework of the neocortex for both biological and machine intelligence under development by <a href="http://numenta.com/">Numenta</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>
	The goal of building intelligent machines is not to replicate human	behavior, nor to build a brain, nor to create machines to do what humans do.  The goal of building intelligent machines is to create machines that work on
	the same principles as the brain -- machines that are able to learn, discover, and adapt in ways that computers can't and brains can.  HTM is a	theory of the neocortex and a few related brain structures; it is not an
	attempt to model or understand every part of the human brain. <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>
	</p>
		
	<h2>HTM Principles</h2>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Common Algorithms in Regions</b> - Every region of the neocortex performs the same set of memory and algorithmic functions, regardless of processing vision, hearing, touch, language, etc.</li>
		<li><b>Hierarchy of Regions</b> - Neocortex organizes regions in a hierarchy</li>
		<li><b>Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs)</b> - only a small percentage of a population of neurons are active at one time.  Symantic similarity</li>
		<li><b>Sensory Encoders</b> - Converts some type of data into an SDR to be processed by HTM algorithms</li>
		<li><b>Sensory-motor Systems</b> - we can't build systems that see and hear like humans do without incorporating movement of the eyes, body, and limbs.</li>
		<li><b>Streaming Data and Sequence Memory</b> - </li>
		<li><b>On-line Learning</b> - </li>
		<li><b>Unsupervised</b> - </li>
	</ul>
		
	<h2>Architecture</h2>

	<h3>Regions</h3>

	<h3>Columns</h3>

	<h3>Cells</h3>

	<h3>Dendrite Segments</h3>

	<p>
		Each dendrite segment has synapses.  For a neuron to recognize a pattern of activity it requires a set of co-located synapses (typically 15-20) that connect to a subset of the cells that are active in the pattern to be
		recognized. Learning to recognize a new pattern is accomplished by the formation of a set of new synapses collocated on a dendritic segment. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
	</p>

	<p>A HTM cell has three types of dendrite segments:</p>

	Proximal
	Distal
	Apical

	<h3>Synapses</h3>

	<p>Synapses form the fundamental memory storage of the neocortex.  HTM has two synaptic properties:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Address</b> - Every synapse grows towards an axon, or cell output.  The address </li>
		<li><b>Permanence</b> - Synaptic permanence shows how connected a synapse is to the axon it grows towards.  Each synapse has a threshold value.  If the permanence is above the threshold the synapse is connected to the
		axon.  If the permanence is below the threshold the synapse is not connected to the axon.</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h2>Algorithms</h2>

	<h3>Synaptic Learning</h3>

	<p>
	HTM Synapses use Hebbian-like learning rules to aquire knowledge about the world.  Note, HTM uses floating-point permanence values from 0.0 to 1.0 while the graphics display integer values from 0 to 99 for aesthetic 
	purposes.  The rules are the same regardless of the data type.

		<p>
			The permanence value is incremented and decremented using a Hebbian-like
			rule. If the permanence value exceeds a threshold, such as 0.3, then
			the weight of the synapse is 1, if the permanence value is at or below
			the threshold then the weight of the synapse is 0. The threshold
			represents the establishment of a synapse, albeit one that could easily
			disappear. A synapse with a permanence value of 1.0 has the same effect
			as a synapse with a permanence value at threshold but is not as easily
			forgotten. Using a scalar permanence value enables on-line learning in
			the presence of noise. A previously unseen input pattern could be noise
			or it could be the start of a new trend that will repeat in the future.
			By growing new synapses, the network can start to learn a new pattern
			when it is first encountered, but only act differently after several
			presentations of the new pattern. Increasing permanence beyond the
			threshold means that patterns experienced more than others will take
			longer to forget. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
