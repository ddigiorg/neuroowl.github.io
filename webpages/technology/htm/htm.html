	<h1>Hierarchical Temporal Memory</h1>

	<p>Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a theoretical framework of the neocortex for both biological and machine intelligence under development by <a href="http://numenta.com/">Numenta</a>.</p>
	
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>
	"The goal of building intelligent machines is not to replicate human behavior, nor to build a brain, nor to create machines to do what humans do.  The goal of building intelligent machines is to create machines that work on
	the same principles as the brain -- machines that are able to learn, discover, and adapt in ways that computers can't and brains can.  HTM is a	theory of the neocortex and a few related brain structures; it is not an 
	attempt to model or understand every part of the human brain." <sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>

	<label for="ar3"><h3>Dendrite Segments</h3></label>
	<div>
		<p>
		Each dendrite segment has synapses.  For a neuron to recognize a pattern of activity it requires a set of co-located synapses (typically 15-20) that connect to a subset of the cells that are active in the pattern to be
		recognized. Learning to recognize a new pattern is accomplished by the formation of a set of new synapses collocated on a dendritic segment. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>

		<p>A HTM cell has three types of dendrite segments:</p>

		<h4>Terms</h4>
				
		Basal
		Distal
		Apical
	</div>

	<input class="toggle-box" id="ar4" type="checkbox">
	<label for="ar4"><h3>Synapses</h3></label>
	<div>
		<p>Synapses form the fundamental memory storage of the neocortex.</p>

		A synapse with a permanence value of 1.0 has the same effect as a synapse with a permanence value at threshold but is not as easily	forgotten.

		Using a scalar permanence value enables on-line learning in
		the presence of noise. A previously unseen input pattern could be noise
		or it could be the start of a new trend that will repeat in the future.
		By growing new synapses, the network can start to learn a new pattern
		when it is first encountered, but only act differently after several
		presentations of the new pattern. Increasing permanence beyond the
		threshold means that patterns experienced more than others will take
		longer to forget. <a href="#2">[2]</a>

		<h4>Terms</h4>

		<ul>
			<li><b>pre-synaptic</b> - refering to where a synapse grows from, specifically the neuron dendrites in biology.</li>
			<li><b>post-synaptic</b> - refering to where a synapse grows towards, specifically the neuron axons in biology.</li>
			<li><b>permanence</b> - how connected a synapse is.</li>
			<li><b>threshold</b> - represents the establishment of a synapse.</li>
			<li><b>connected</b> - a synapse that has its permanence equal to or greater than the threshold value and therefore is affected by post-synaptic cell active or inactive states.</li>
			<li><b>unconnected</b> - a synapse that has its permanence less than the threshold value and therefore is not affected by post-synaptic cell active or inactive states.</li>

	<h2>Algorithms</h2>

	<input class="toggle-box" id="al0" type="checkbox">
	<label for="al0"><h3>Synaptic Learning</h3></label>
	<div>
		<p>
		HTM synapses use Hebbian-like learning rules to aquire knowledge about the world by modifying address and permanence values.  Note, HTM uses floating-point permanence values from 0.0 to 1.0 with a threshold of 0.3 
		while the graphics display integer values from 0 to	99 with a threshold of 30 for aesthetic purposes.  The learning rate for the graphics is 5.  The synaptic learning rules are the same regardless of the data type.
		</p>

		<h4>Initialization</h4>

		<p>Synapse addresses may be randomly initialized or arranged within a receptive field.  Synapse permanences are initialized on or slightly below the threshold.</p>

		<img src="/webpages/technology/htm/syn-initialization.png" alt="syn-initialization" style="margin: 25px auto">

		<h4>Increment Permanence</h4>

		<p>If the post-synaptic cell is active, then increment the synapse permanence by the learning rate.</p>

		<img src="/webpages/technology/htm/syn-increment.gif" alt="syn-increment" style="margin: 25px auto">

		<h4>Decrement Permanence</h4>

		<p>If the post-synaptic cell is inactive, then decrement the synapse permanence by the learning rate.</p>

		<img src="/webpages/technology/htm/syn-decrement.gif" alt="syn-decrement" style="margin: 25px auto">

		<h4>Adapt Synapse</h4>

		<p>If the synapse permanence is 0, then assign the synapse address to an unused post-synaptic cell and set the permanence just below the threshold.</p>

		<img src="/webpages/technology/htm/syn-adapt.gif" alt="syn-adapt" style="margin: 25px auto">

		<h4>Insert Synapse</h4>

		<img src="/webpages/technology/htm/syn-insert.gif" alt="syn-insert" style="margin: 25px auto">

		<h4>Cull Synapse</h4>

		<img src="/webpages/technology/htm/syn-cull.gif" alt="syn-cull" style="margin: 25px auto">
	</div>

	<input class="toggle-box" id="al1" type="checkbox">
	<label for="al1"><h3>Spatial Pooling</h3></label>
	<div>
		<p>The Spatial Pooling algorithm selects a set of columns that best represent the input SDR at a single time step.  This is how an HTM region processes patterns, concurrent cell activations.</p>

		<img src="/webpages/technology/htm/sp.gif" alt="sp" style="margin: 25px auto">

		<h4>Overlap</h4>

		<p>
		Spatial Pooling must first compute an overlap value for each column.  It does this by comparing each column's proximal dendrite segment synapses with the input SDR.  For each synapse in the column's proximal dendrite 
		segment, if the synapse is connected and the post-synaptic cell is active, increment the column's overlap.  Otherwise there is no effect on the column's overlap.
		</p>

		<h4>Inhibition</h4>

		<p>
		After each column computes its own overlap value, Spatial Pooling activates a specified number of columns with the highest overlap score.  Other columns may represent the input pattern quite well, however they are 
		being inhibited by columns with a stronger match.
		</p>

		<h4>Learning</h4>

		<p>Finally, Spatial Pooling uses the synaptic learning rules found in the previous section.</p>

	<input class="toggle-box" id="al2" type="checkbox">
	<label for="al2"><h3>Temporal Memory</h3></label>
	<div>
		<p>The Temporal Memory algorithm uses previous cell states to set current cell states.  This is how an HTM region processes sequences, temporal cell activations.</p>

		<img src="/webpages/technology/htm/tm.gif" alt="tm" style="margin: 25px auto">

		<h4>Activation</h4>

		<p>If a cell in an active column at the current timestep is in the predict state at the previous timestep, then set the cell to the active state.</p>

		<h4>Bursting</h4>

		<p>If no cells in an active column at the current timestep are in the predict state at the previous timestep, then set all cells in the active column to the active state.</p>

		<h4>Prediction</h4>
