		<h1>Hierarchical Temporal Memory</h1>
		<p>
			Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a theoretical framework of the
			neocortex for both biological and machine intelligence under development by
			Numenta <a href="#1">[1]</a>.  Therefore, the topics below may contain
			redundant information concerning neuroscience topics found on this website
			that are critical to understanding HTM theory.  Additionally, the researchers
			at Numenta are constantly evolving the theory and although the main principles
			presented below remain steady throughout HTM's development, a few details
			may be missing or dated.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			The ultimate promise of brain theory and machine intelligence is the
			acquisition	and dissemination of new knowledge. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The goal of building intelligent machines is not to replicate human
			behavior, nor to build a brain, nor to create machines to do what humans do.
			The goal of building intelligent machines is to create machines that work
			on the same principles as the brain -- machines that are able to learn,
			discover, and adapt in ways that computers can't and brains can.  HTM is a
			theory of the neocortex and a few related brain structures; it is not an
			attempt to model or understand every part of the human brain.
			<a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Intelligence is the ability to acquire knowledge in an attempt to achieve
			a wide range of goals.  Something that is intelligent [Ref]:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>continuously learns</li>
			<li>interacts with the environment</li>
			<li>is general in nature</li>
			<li>has goal-oriented behavior</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>HTM Principles</h2>
		<h3>Common Algorithms in Regions</h3>
		<p>
			Every region of the neocortex performs the same set of memory and
			algorithmic functions.  We know that brains use common principles for
			vision, hearing, touch, language, and behavior. This remarkable fact was
			first proposed in 1979 by Vernon Mountcastle [REF?].  We strive not to
			understand vision or hearing or	robotics as separate problems, but to
			understand how these capabilities are fundamentally all the same, and
			what set of algorithms can see AND hear AND generate behavior.
			<a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		<h3>Hierarchy of Regions</h3>
		<p>
			Every neocortex organizes these regions in a hierarchies.
		</p>
		<h3>Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs)</h3>
		<p>
			An active neuron is one that is generating spikes, or action potentials.
			One of the most remarkable observations about the neocortex is that no
			matter where you look, the activity of neurons is sparse, meaning only
			a small percentage of them are rapidly spiking at any point in time.
			The sparsity might vary from less than one percent to several percent,
			but it is always sparse. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			In HTM SDRs are the representation format used by the neocortex.  SDRs
			are	vectors with thousands of bits.  At any point in time a small
			percentage of the bits are 1's and the rest are 0's. With SDRs, the bits
			of the representation encode the semantic properties of the
			representation; the representation and its meaning are one and the
			same. Two SDRs that have 1 bits in the same location share a semantic
			property. The more 1 bits two SDRs share, the more semantically similar
			are the two representations. The SDR explains how brains make semantic
			generalizations; it is an inherent property of the representation
			method. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		<p>[SDR PICTURE]</p>
		<h3>Sensory Encoders</h3>
		<p>
			Every HTM system needs the equivalent of sensory organs. We call these
			"encoders".  An encoder takes some type of data -- it could be a number,
			time, temperature, image, or GPS location -- and turns it into a SDR that
			can be digested by the HTM learning algorithms. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>

		<h3>Sensory-motor Systems</h3>
		<p>
			Neuroanatomy tells us tells us that every region of the neocortex has
			both sensory and motor functions.  Therefore, vision, hearing, and touch
			are integrated sensory-motor senses; we can't build systems that see and
			hear like humans do without incorporating movement of the eyes, body,
			and limbs. <a href="#2">[2]</a>

		<h2>HTM Neocortical Structure Overview</h2>
		<p>
			The human neocortex:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				occupies about 75% of the brain's volume <a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				No one knows exactly how many neurons are in a human neocortex, but
				recent "primate scale up" methods put the estimate at 86 billion
				<a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				is a sheet of neural tissue about 1000 square cm in area and 2.5mm
				thick <a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				one square mm of cortex has about 100K neurons and 1B synapses
				<a href="#6">[6]</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				is distributed in 6 layers (actually more like nine layers 1, 2, 3a, 3b,
				4, 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b) <a href="#6">[6]</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Region</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Multilayered patches of grey matter
			</li>
			<li>
				Sometimes referred to as a "macrocolumn" or "cortical column"
			</li>
			<li>
				About 1.0-1.5 square mm in area and contains about 2000+ minicolumns
				<a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				Many regions connected together form a "brain region" such as V1
			</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="images/technology/htm/region.png" alt="region" style="margin: 25px auto">
		<h3>Minicolumn</h3>
		<p>
			WIP
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				About 30-50 microns wide with 100-120 neurons across all 6 layers.
				<a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Neuron</h3>
		<p>
			Pyramidal neurons represent the majority of excitatory neurons in the
			neocortex. Each pyramidal neuron receives input from thousands of
			excitatory synapses that are segregated onto dendritic branches. The
			dendrites themselves are segregated into apical, basal, and proximal
			integration zones, which have different properties. Experimental results
			show that the coincident activation of 8-20 synapses in close spatial
			proximity on a dendrite will combine in a non-linear fashion and cause
			an NMDA dendritic spike. Thus, a small set of neighboring synapses acts
			as a pattern detector.<a href="#3">[3]</a>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Proximal Dendrites</b>: The proximal synapses, those closest to
				the cell body, define the receptive field, or feedforward input, of
				a cell.  Proximal synapses a relatively large effect at the soma,
				directly lead to action potentials, or active state.
				<a href="#3">[3]</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>(Distal) Basal Dendrites</b>: Basal synapses learn transitions
				in sequences.  When a pattern is recognized on a basal dendrite it
				generates an NMDA spike. The depolarization due to an NMDA spike
				attenuates in amplitude by the time it reaches the soma, therefore
				when a basal dendrite recognizes a pattern it will depolarize the
				soma but not enough to generate a somatic action potential.  This
				puts the cell in a predictive state, meaning a slightly depolarized
				cell fires earlier than it would otherwise if it subsequently
				receives sufficient feedforward input. <a href="#3">[3]</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>(Distal) Apical Dendrites</b>: Apical synapses invoke a top-down
				expectation.  NMDA spikes generated depolarize
				the soma but typically not sufficiently to generate a somatic action
				potential. This puts the cell in a predictive state.
				<a href="#3">[3]</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Synaptic Learning</h3>
		<p>
			Each dendrite segment has synapses, which form the fundamental memory
			storage of the neocortex.  For a neuron to recognize a pattern of
			activity it requires a set of co-located synapses (typically 15-20)
			that connect to a subset of the cells that are active in the pattern to
			be recognized. Learning to recognize a new pattern is accomplished by
			the formation of a set of new synapses collocated on a dendritic
			segment. <a href="#3">[3]</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The permanence value is incremented and decremented using a Hebbian-like
			rule. If the permanence value exceeds a threshold, such as 0.3, then
			the weight of the synapse is 1, if the permanence value is at or below
			the threshold then the weight of the synapse is 0. The threshold
			represents the establishment of a synapse, albeit one that could easily
			disappear. A synapse with a permanence value of 1.0 has the same effect
			as a synapse with a permanence value at threshold but is not as easily
			forgotten. Using a scalar permanence value enables on-line learning in
			the presence of noise. A previously unseen input pattern could be noise
			or it could be the start of a new trend that will repeat in the future.
			By growing new synapses, the network can start to learn a new pattern
			when it is first encountered, but only act differently after several
			presentations of the new pattern. Increasing permanence beyond the
			threshold means that patterns experienced more than others will take
			longer to forget. <a href="#3">[3]</a>
		</p>
		<img src="images/technology/htm/synaptic_learning.png" alt="synaptic_learning" style="margin: 25px auto">
		<p>
			*Note: Numenta uses floating permanence values from 0.0 to 1.0.  I
			prefer to use int8 values from 0 to 99, which is why the figures above
			display integer permanence values.

		<h2>Layer 3b</h2>
		<p>
			In the human neocortex, layer 3b primarily contains pyramidal neurons.
			In HTM, Layer 3b handles sequence memory which is the recognition and
			inference of inputted patterns over time and predition of future patterns.
			Proximal dendrites of cells in L3b receive signals from sensory encoders
			and spatially pool, selecting a sparse set of active minicolumns.  Then
			cells are set to active state, predict state based on basal synapse
			connections, and winner state which is an artefact of the L3b algorithm.
		</p>
		<p>
			This graphic gives an outline of how L3b algorithm functions in HTM.
