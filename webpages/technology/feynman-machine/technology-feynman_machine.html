		<h1>Feynman Machine</h1>
		<p>
			The Feynman Machine is a machine intelligence model derived from
			intelligence principles	of the mammalian neocortex, Deep Learning,
			Hierarchical Temporal Memory, and the Applied Mathematics of interacting
			Dynamical Systems.  This technology is under development by Ogma
			Intelligent Systems Corp. <a href="#1">[1]</a>
		</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			Many real-world problems cannot be tractably solved analytically or are
			extremely difficult to model precisely and thus fall under Dynamical Systems
			and Chaos Theory.  Often solvers of these problems do not have access to the
			underlying mathematics, logic, internal dynamics (the differential or
			difference equations governing the update rules), control parameters which
			vary the global properties of the system, or the exact values of the
			observables of the system.  Therefore, a simpler and in many ways more
			powerful method comes from Takens Theorum: reconstruction of the dynamics
			using signals from the observed system.  The essence of the strategy is
			that sufficient information about the observed system is encoded in its
			signal to allow its reconstruction in an observing system using very simple
			computations. <a href="#3">[3]</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			The mammalian neocortex is a Universal Modeller of Dynamical Systems. It
			is a Complex System, a hierarchy-like network of interconnected and coupled
			regions, each of which is operating as a dynamical system modelling a
			dynamical system.  Cortical structures use a time-series of spatiotemporal
			sensorimotor inputs to:
			<ul>
				<li>
					generate a dynamical analogue of the system generating the inputs
				</li>
				<li>
					forecast its short-term future
				</li>
				<li>
					identify stable and slowly-changing characteristics of the system which
					indicate its hidden controlling parameters or state
				</li>
				<li>
					model the nonstationarity of the system state
				</li>
				<li>
					interact with the system using time series of motor outputs
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Applied Mathematics</h2>
			<h3>Dynamical Systems</h3>
		<p>
			A Dynamical System is a mathematical model whose dynamics are
			characterised by express update rules, typically differential equations
			in continuous systems, or difference equations in discrete time
			(Strogatz [2014]) <a href="#2">[2]</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			A classical Dynamical System can be seen as a vector field or flow in its
			state (or phase) space, where the value of the vector field at each point
			is effectively a velocity vector indicating how the state at the point
			will change, tracing out a trajectory over time.


			In dynamical systems, causally interacting variables (say x, y and z)
			share a trajectory in the state/phase space (a geometrical manifold).  At
			any given time, a dynamical system has a state given by a set of real
			numbers(a vector) that can be represented by a point in an appropriate
			state space  <a href="#4">[4]</a>.  An attractor is a set of numerical
			values toward which a system tends to evolve, for a	wide variety of
			starting conditions of the system.
		</p>
		<p>
			In 1963, Edward Lorenz developed a simplified mathematical model for
			atmospheric convection using 3 coupled differential equations.  It is
			notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and
			initial conditions.	<a href="#6">[6]</a>

			<li><b>x, y, z</b> make up the system states and are abstractions of the state of the convecting fluid</li>

		</ul>
		<h3>Chaos Theory</h3>
		<p>
			Chaos theory is the field of study in mathematics that studies the
			behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial
			conditions which yield widely diverging outcomes for the system
			<a href="#5">[5]</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Takens Embedding Theorum</h3>
		<p>
			Takens Embedding Theorum (Takens 1981) builds upon Whitney Embedding
			Theorem (Whitney 1936) and shows that smoothly evolving dynamical systems
			and their manifolds can be reconstructed in all important details by
			measuring time-series lags from a single state of the system
			<a href="#3">[3]</a>:

		<p align="center" , style="font-size: 20px">
			&Phi; = [x(t), x(t - &tau;), x(t - 2&tau;), ..., x(t - k&tau;)]
			&nbsp; &nbsp; k > 2m + 1
		</p>
		<ul style="list-style: none">
			<li><b>&Phi;</b> is the vector of time-delayed measurements</li>
			<li><b>x</b> is the observed value at a certain time</li>
			<li><b>t</b> is time</li>
			<li><b>&tau;</b> is time delay</li>
			<li><b>m</b> is manifold dimension</li>
			<li><b>k</b> is the embedding dimension</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Although the reconstruction is not visually identical to the original
			system, it is topologically identical and preserves essential
			mathematical properties of the original system:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Diffeomorphism</b>: A diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of smooth
				manifolds. It is an invertible function that maps one differentiable
				manifold to another such that both the function and its inverse are
				smooth <a href="#7">[7]</a>.  It is just a particularly user-friendly
				function, which allows you to take a problem in one space, solve it
				some "easier" space, and translate your solution back to the
				"difficult" space to apply it.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Lyapunov exponents</b>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Feynman Machine Architecture</h2>
		<img src="images/technology/feynman_machine/fig3.png" alt="fig3" style="margin: 25px auto">
		<p>
			A Feynman Machine is a collection of Dynamical Systems modules called
			regions, connected together in a ladder-like hierarchy of paired
			encoders and decoders.  A Feynman Machine is connected to its external
			world via sensorimotor channels, each of which carries a (usually
			high-dimensional) time series signal of some kind.  Each region is capable
			of adaptively learning, representing, predicting and interacting with the
			spatiotemporal, sensorimotor structure of its "world". <a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Information flows both up the hierarchy (feature extraction), and down the
			hierarchy (prediction). Each encoder-decoder pair or predictor attempts to
			predict its inputs, ie the state of the layer below it, one timestep in
			advance. Lower layers use feedback information from the layers above to
			improve their own predictions. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Each encoder-decoder pair is a kind of spatiotemporal autoencoder, receiving
			information, mapping to a hidden representation, and using that to predict
			the next frame of information.  Predictions are compared with the actual
			next input, and this prediction error can be used to drive learning.
			<a href="#2">[2]</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of the generality of the theory of networked Dynamical Systems, we
			can choose to use many designs for the encoders and decoders, based on their
			different properties. The design we've found most useful in experiments and
			application is an online, spatiotemporal modification of the k-sparse
			autoencoder (Makhzani and Frey, 2013). <a href="#2">[2]</a>
