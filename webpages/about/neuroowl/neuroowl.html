		<h1>Why "Neuroowl"?</h1>
			<p>	
				The owl	is a fitting symbol for AI inspired by the cover of 
				"Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies" by philosopher Nick Bostrom 
				and the cute short story contained within: "The Unfinished Fable of the 
				Sparrows".  Owls are solitary and nocturnal birds of prey found across the 
				world.	 Modern Western culture use owls as symbols of knowledge, wisdom, 
				perspicacity, and erudition.  This stems from ancient Greek symbolic use of 
				the owl for the city of Athens,	known for scholarship, and Athena, goddess 
				wisdom.  However, many African and Native American cultures believed that 
				owls were the harbingers of death, its hoot a portent of someone's demise!

				The dichotomy of the owl symbol of AI between benevolent intelligence and 
				omen of death is often the subject of discussion and science fiction.  
				Many researchers and philosophers consider AI to be the last invention
				mankind need ever make [Ref].  A device that can cogitate possibly faster,
				more efficiently, and with greater accuracy than the human neocortex would
				be the "holy grail" of mankind considering the biological brain's 
				advancements of technology,	art, society, and culture.  However, the danger
				of something that can think and create better than us is we	lose the #1 spot
				for intelligence, an evolutionary trait that put humans at the top of the 
				food chain.  A device such as this not on "Team Humanity" could be 
				disastrous.

				Personally, I think time will show that a truly Artificial General 
				Intelligence (AGI) will be a completely neutral technology.  It will be
				a knowledge multiplier for whatever application humans choose to invest in,
				be it welfare or war.  Read on in the Philosophy section for more!
