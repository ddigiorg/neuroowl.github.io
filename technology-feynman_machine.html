		<h1>Feynman Machine</h1>
			<p>
				The Feynman Machine is a machine intelligence model derived from 
				intelligence principles	of the mammalian neocortex, deep learning 
				architecture, and the Applied Mathematics of interacting Dynamical 
				Systems.  This technology is under development by Ogma Intelligent 
				Systems Corp. <a href="#1">[1]</a>
			</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				The neocortex is a Universal Modeller of Dynamical Systems, in which each 
				region learns to lock onto the dynamics of its inputs, characterise and 
				represent their underlying causal parameters (along with their 
				nonstationarity), and act on them through both feedback and behaviour. 
				<a href="#3">[3]</a>
				
				hypothesis: the neocortex is a hierarchy-like network of interconnected and 
				coupled regions, each of which is operating as a dynamical system modelling 
				a dynamical system. <a href="#3">[3]</a>
				
				Our hypothesis is that the structure of a region of neocortex has evolved 
				to use a time series of sensory (and sensorimotor) inputs to generate a 
				dynamical analogue of the system generating the sensory inputs, to forecast 
				its short-term future, to identify stable and slowly-changing 
				characteristics of the system which indicate its hidden controlling 
				parameters or state, to model the nonstationarity of the system state, and 
				to interact with the system using time series of motor outputs. 
				<a href="#3">[3]</a>
			</p>
		<h2>Applied Mathematics: Dynamical Systems</h2>
			<p>
				A Dynamical System is a mathematical model whose dynamics are characterised
				by express update rules, typically differential equations in continuous 
				systems, or difference equations in discrete time (Strogatz [2014]) 
				<a href="#2">[2]</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				At any given time, a dynamical system has a state given by a set of real 
				numbers (a vector) that can be represented by a point in an appropriate 
				state space (a geometrical manifold). The evolution rule of the dynamical 
				system is a function that describes what future states follow from the 
				current state. Often the function is deterministic; in other words, for a 
				given time interval only one future state follows from the current state;
				however, some systems are stochastic, in that random events also affect 
				the evolution of the state variables. <a href="#4">[4]</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				With the advent of computers in the mid-20th century, researchers have been 
				able to study the dynamics of nonlinear and complex systems, and since the
				1960s this has become a primary focus of Applied Mathematics.

			<h3>Chaos Theory</h3>
			<h3>Takens Theorum</h3>
				<p>
					Takens [1981] and others showed that the dynamics of many real-world 
					dynamical systems could be directly and accurately modelled based only 
					on simply observing measurements of the real-world systems over time. 
					
					This mathematical property allows an agent to characterise an observed 
					system and perform short-range forecasting of its future behaviour, 
					without having access to the underlying causal mechanics or latent 
					parameters of the system. <a href="#3">[3]</a>
					
					Floris Takens [1981], basing his study on results going back to Whitney 
					[1936], proved that a system such as Lorenzâ€™ could be reconstructed in 
					all important details using only a time-series of a single measurement 
					from the system. 
				</p>
			<h3>Lorenz System: An Example of a Chaotic Dynamical System and Takens Theorum</h3>
				<p>
					In 1963, Edward Lorenz developed a simplified mathematical model for 
					atmospheric convection using 3 coupled differential equations.  It is 
					notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and 
					initial conditions.	<a href="#5">[5]</a>

		<h2>Feynman Machine Architecture</h2>
			<p>
				A Feynman Machine is a collection of Dynamical Systems modules called 
				regions, connected together in a network or hierarchy, and to its external 
				world, via sensorimotor channels, each of which carries a (usually 
				high-dimensional) time	series signal of some kind. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</p>
			<h3>Region</h3>
				<p>
					Each region is capable of adaptively learning, representing, predicting 
					and interacting with the spatiotemporal, sensorimotor structure of its 
					"world". <a href="#2">[2]</a>
