		<h1>Feynman Machine</h1>
			<p>
				The Feynman Machine is a machine intelligence model derived from 
				intelligence principles	of the mammalian neocortex, Deep Learning, 
				Hierarchical Temporal Memory, and the Applied Mathematics of interacting 
				Dynamical Systems.  This technology is under development by Ogma 
				Intelligent Systems Corp. <a href="#1">[1]</a>
			</p>
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				Many real-world problems cannot be tractably solved analytically or are 
				extremely difficult to model precisely and thus fall under Dynamical Systems
				and Chaos Theory.  Often solvers of these problems do not have access to the
				underlying mathematics, logic, internal dynamics (the differential or 
				difference equations governing the update rules), control parameters which 
				vary the global properties of the system, or the exact values of the 
				observables of the system.  Therefore, a simpler and in many ways more
				powerful method comes from Takens Theorum: reconstruction of the dynamics 
				using signals from the observed system.  The essence of the strategy is 
				that sufficient information about the observed system is encoded in its 
				signal to allow its reconstruction in an observing system using very simple 
				computations. <a href="#3">[3]</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				The mammalian neocortex is a Universal Modeller of Dynamical Systems. It 
				is a Complex System, a hierarchy-like network of interconnected and coupled
				regions, each of which is operating as a dynamical system modelling a 
				dynamical system.  Cortical structures use a time-series of spatiotemporal 
				sensorimotor inputs to:
			<ul>
				<li> 
					generate a dynamical analogue of the system generating the inputs
				</li>
				<li>
					forecast its short-term future
				</li>
				<li>
					identify stable and slowly-changing characteristics of the system which 
					indicate its hidden controlling parameters or state
				</li>
				<li>
					model the nonstationarity of the system state
				</li>
				<li>
					interact with the system using time series of motor outputs
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Dynamical Systems</h3>
				<p>
					A Dynamical System is a mathematical model whose dynamics are 
					characterised by express update rules, typically differential equations 
					in continuous systems, or difference equations in discrete time 
					(Strogatz [2014]) <a href="#2">[2]</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					A classical Dynamical System can be seen as a vector field or flow in its
					state (or phase) space, where the value of the vector field at each point
					is effectively a velocity vector indicating how the state at the point 
					will change, tracing out a trajectory over time.
					
					
					In dynamical systems, causally interacting variables (say x, y and z) 
					share a trajectory in the state/phase space (a geometrical manifold) 
					<a href="#7">[7]</a>.  At any given time, a dynamical system has a state 
					given by a set of real numbers(a vector) that can be represented by a 
					point in an appropriate state space  <a href="#4">[4]</a>.  An attractor 
					is a set of numerical values toward which a system tends to evolve, for a
					wide variety of starting conditions of the system.
				</p>

				<p>
					In 1963, Edward Lorenz developed a simplified mathematical model for 
					atmospheric convection using 3 coupled differential equations.  It is 
					notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and 
					initial conditions.	<a href="#6">[6]</a>
				</p>
				<ul style="list-style: none">
					<li><b>x, y, z</b> make up the system states and are abstractions of the state of the convecting fluid</li>
					<li><b>x</b> is proportional to the intensity of the convective motion</li>
					<li><b>y</b> is proportional to the temperature difference of ascending and descending currents</li>
					<li><b>z</b> is proportional to the departure of the vertical temperature profile from linearity</li>
					<li><b>t</b> is time</li>
					<li><b>&sigma;</b> is a system control parameter.  Lorenz used <b>&sigma;</b> = 10</li>
					<li><b>&rho;</b> is a system control parameter.  Lorenz used <b>&rho;</b> = 28</li>
					<li><b>&beta;</b> is a system control parameter.  Lorenz used <b>&beta;</b> = 8/3</li>
				</ul>
				<p>					
					The evolution rule of the dynamical system is a function that describes 
					what future states follow from the current state. Often the function is 
					deterministic; in other words, for a given time interval only one future 
					state follows from the current state; however, some systems are 
					stochastic, in that random events also affect the evolution of the state 
					variables. <a href="#4">[4]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
			<h3>Chaos Theory</h3>
				<p>
					Chaos theory is the field of study in mathematics that studies the 
					behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial 
					conditions which yield widely diverging outcomes for the system
					<a href="#5">[5]</a>.  The behavior of chaotic systems appears random
					even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future
					dynamics are fully defined by their initial conditions.
				</p>
			<h3>Takens Embedding Theorum</h3>
				<p>
					Floris Takens [1981], basing his study on results going back to Whitney 
					[1936], proved that a system could be reconstructed (or embedded) in all
					important details using only a time-series of a single measurement from 
					the system, or in other words by simply observing measurements of the 
					real-world systems over time <a href="#3">[3]</a>.  Takens' theorum
					is also refered to as a delay embedding theorum.
				</p>
				<p align="center", style="font-size: 20px">
					&Phi; = ( x(t), x(t-&tau;), x(t-2&tau;), ... x(t-k&tau;) ) of k > 2m + 1
					observed values x
				</p>
				<ul style="list-style: none">
					<li><b>&Phi;</b> is the vector of time-delayed measurements</li>
					<li><b>x</b> is the observed value at a certain time</li>
					<li><b>t</b> is time</li>
					<li><b>&tau;</b> is time delay</li>
					<li><b>m</b> is manifold dimension</li>
					<li><b>k</b> is the embedding dimension or number of measured points</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="images/technology/feynman_machine/fig2.png" alt="fig2" style="margin: 25px auto">
				<p>
					The embedding model reconstructed from the time series observation is 
					practically the same thing as the system being observed.  Although the
					reconstruction is not visually identical to the original system, it is
					topologically identical, or diffeomorphic.
				</p>
				<p>
					This mathematical property allows an agent to characterise an observed 
					system and perform short-range forecasting of its future behaviour, 
					without having access to the underlying causal mechanics or latent 
					parameters of the system. <a href="#3">[3]</a>
				</p>
			<h3>Diffeomorphism</h3>
				<p>
					A diffeomorphism is an isomorphism of smooth manifolds. It is an 
					invertible function that maps one differentiable manifold to another such 
					that both the function and its inverse are smooth. [diffeomorphism wiki]

		<h2>Feynman Machine Architecture</h2>
			<img src="images/technology/feynman_machine/fig3.png" alt="fig3" style="margin: 25px auto">
			<p>
				A Feynman Machine is a collection of Dynamical Systems modules called 
				regions, connected together in a ladder-like hierarchy of paired
				encoders and decoders.  A Feynman Machine is connected to its external 
				world via sensorimotor channels, each of which carries a (usually 
				high-dimensional) time series signal of some kind.  Each region is capable 
				of adaptively learning, representing, predicting and interacting with the 
				spatiotemporal, sensorimotor structure of its "world". <a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Information flows both up the hierarchy (feature extraction), and down the 
				hierarchy (prediction). Each encoder-decoder pair or predictor attempts to 
				predict its inputs, ie the state of the layer below it, one timestep in 
				advance. Lower layers use feedback information from the layers above to 
				improve their own predictions. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Each encoder-decoder pair is a kind of spatiotemporal autoencoder, receiving
				information, mapping to a hidden representation, and using that to predict 
				the next frame of information.  Predictions are compared with the actual 
				next input, and this prediction error can be used to drive learning.
				<a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Because of the generality of the theory of networked Dynamical Systems, we 
				can choose to use many designs for the encoders and decoders, based on their
				different properties. The design we've found most useful in experiments and
				application is an online, spatiotemporal modification of the k-sparse 
				autoencoder (Makhzani and Frey, 2013). <a href="#2">[2]</a>
