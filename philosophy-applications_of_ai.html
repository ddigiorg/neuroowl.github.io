		<h1>Applications of AI</h1>
			<p>
				What are the potential applications of machine intelligence technology and 
				how may it serve humanity?
			</p>
			<h3>Transhuman Sensing</h3>
				<p>
					Humans directly experience perceived reality within specific sensory
					systems: sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell (a more detailed look at
					the human sensory systems may be found in Neuroscience - Human 
					Overview).   
					
					However, we know of forces beyond our direct sensory experience like 
					electromagnetism, ultrasound, data flow through the internet, gravity, 
					quantum	forces, et al.  These indirect sensations require equipment and 
					technology to transform indirect information to direct, human intuitive 
					information	like mathematical and graphical models.
				</p>
				<p>
					A machine cortex may operate like a human cortex: pattern recognition,
					inference, prediction, creativity, selective attention, etc. However, a
					machine intelligence is not bound by human biological sensing 
					capabilities.  All human wonders of technology, art, and culture
					have been achieved through these 5 senses supplemented by models.  
					What undreamed of could AI create if they had an intuitive 
					sense of sensory spaces humans labor their whole lives to grasp and 
					understand.  Imagine if you could figuratively "see" gravity.  Advanced
					concepts like special relativity would be relatively intuitive, much 
					like seeing your pet dog or cat lick itself.  Imagine you could directly 
					access the wireless internet with your brain by sensing the right 
					electromagnetic	waves.
