		<h1>Hierarchical Temporal Memory</h1>
			<p>
				Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a theoretical framework of the 
				neocortex for both biological and machine intelligence under development by
				Numenta <a href="#1">[1]</a>.  Therefore, the topics below may contain 
				redundant information concerning neuroscience topics found on this website
				that are critical to understanding HTM theory.  Additionally, the researchers
				at Numenta are constantly evolving the theory.  Although the main principles
				presented below remain steady throughout HTM's development, a few details 
				may be missing or dated.

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				The ultimate promise of brain theory and machine intelligence is the 
				acquisition	and dissemination of new knowledge. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				The goal of building intelligent machines is not to replicate human 
				behavior, nor to build a brain, nor to create machines to do what humans do. 
				The goal of building intelligent machines is to create machines that work 
				on the same principles as the brain -- machines that are able to learn, 
				discover, and adapt in ways that computers can't and brains can.  HTM is a 
				theory of the neocortex and a few related brain structures; it is not an 
				attempt to model or understand every part of the human brain.
				<a href="#2">[2]</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Intelligence is the ability to acquire knowledge in an attempt to achieve
				a wide range of goals.  Something that is intelligent:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>continuously learns</li>
				<li>interacts with the environment</li>
				<li>is general in nature</li>
				<li>has goal-oriented behavior</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>HTM Principles</h2>
			<h3>Common Algorithms in Regions</h3>
				<p>
					Every region of the neocortex performs the same set of memory and 
					algorithmic functions.  We know that brains use common principles for
					vision, hearing, touch, language, and behavior. This remarkable fact was
					first proposed in 1979 by Vernon Mountcastle [REF].  We strive not to 
					understand vision or hearing or	robotics as separate problems, but to 
					understand how these capabilities are fundamentally all the same, and 
					what set of algorithms can see AND hear AND generate behavior. 
					<a href="#2">[2]</a>
				</p>
			<h3>Hierarchy of Regions</h3>
				<p>
					Every neocortex organizes these regions in a hierarchies.
				</p>
			<h3>Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs)</h3>
				<p>
					An active neuron is one that is generating spikes, or action potentials.
					One of the most remarkable observations about the neocortex is that no 
					matter where you look, the activity of neurons is sparse, meaning only 
					a small percentage of them are rapidly spiking at any point in time. 
					The sparsity might vary from less than one percent to several percent, 
					but it is always sparse. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
				</p>
				<p>
					In HTM SDRs are the representation format used by the neocortex.  SDRs 
					are	vectors with thousands of bits.  At any point in time a small 
					percentage of the bits are 1's and the rest are 0's. With SDRs, the bits
					of the representation encode the semantic properties of the 
					representation; the representation and its meaning are one and the 
					same. Two SDRs that have 1 bits in the same location share a semantic 
					property. The more 1 bits two SDRs share, the more semantically similar
					are the two representations. The SDR explains how brains make semantic 
					generalizations; it is an inherent property of the representation 
					method. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
				</p>
				<p>[SDR PICTURE]</p>
			<h3>Sensory Encoders</h3>
				<p>
					Every HTM system needs the equivalent of sensory organs. We call these
					"encoders".  An encoder takes some type of data -- it could be a number, 
					time, temperature, image, or GPS location -- and turns it into a SDR that 
					can be digested by the HTM learning algorithms. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
				</p>

			<h3>Sensory-motor Systems</h3>
				<p>
					Neuroanatomy tells us tells us that every region of the neocortex has 
					both sensory and motor functions.  Therefore, vision, hearing, and touch
					are integrated sensory-motor senses; we can't build systems that see and
					hear like humans do without incorporating movement of the eyes, body, 
					and limbs. <a href="#2">[2]</a>

			<h3>Spatial Pooling</h3>
			<h3>Temporal Memory</h3>
		<h2>HTM Neocortical Structure</h2>
			<p>
				The human neocortex <a href="#2">[2]</a>:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>occupies about 75% of the brain's volume</li>
				<li>
					No one knows exactly how many neurons are in a human neocortex, but 
					recent "primate scale up" methods put the estimate at 86 billion
					(Herculano-Houzel, 2012). <a href="#2">[2]</a>
				</li>
				<li>is a sheet of neural tissue about 1000 square cm in area and 2.5mm thick</li>
				<li>one square mm of cortex has about 100K neurons and 1B synapses</li>
				<li>
					is distributed in 6 layers (actually more like nine layers 1, 2, 3a, 3b,
					4, 5a, 5b, 6a, 6b)
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>HTM Region</h3>
				<p>
					Cortical regions are defined by connectivity. Regions pass information 
					to each other by sending bundles of nerve fibers into the white matter
					just below the neocortex. The nerve fibers re-enter at another 
					neocortical region. The connections between regions define a logical 
					hierarchy. <a href="#2">[2]</a>
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In the human neocortex a cortical region is about 1.0-1.5 square mm in area and contains about 2000+ minicolumns</li>
					<li>One HTM Region has 2048 minicolumns under 1 spatial pooler</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Layer 1</h3>
			<h3>Layer 2</h3>
			<h3>Layer 3a</h3>
			<h3>Layer 3b</h3>
				<img src="images/technology/htm/layer3b.png" alt="layer3b" style="margin: 25px auto">
			<h3>HTM Column (Minicolumn)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>About 30-50 microns wide with 100-120 neurons across all 6 layers</li>
					<li>HTM: 32 cells per mini-column in layer 3 implementation</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>HTM Cell</h3>
				<p>
					A HTM cell is a modeled based on pyramidal neurons, the most common type
					of neuron in the neocortex.  The pyramidal neuron is the core 
					information processing element of the neocortex, and synapses are the
					substrate of memory <a href="#2">[2]</a>.  In a real neuron when it is 
					in an active state the axon outputs a short burst of action potentials.
					When it is in a predictive state the axon outputs a slower, steady rate
					of action potentials. In the HTM cell model these action potentials are 
					only binary "on" or "off" to represent a cell's state.
